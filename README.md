# :sparkles: Elena - Shopify App Development Course Sourse Files :sparkles:

Shopify is growing exponentially! A lot of eCommerce businesses are being built using Shopify. Why not take this opportunity to learn how to create a Shopify app and make a profit out of it by making an app that works and helps Shopify merchants.

__Where did these files come from?__

This project is created from the [Shopify App Development with Node, React, REST API & GraphQL](https://weeklyhow.com/learn/shopify-app-dev)

__What are these project files for?__

There will be instances where you get an error and you're not sure why. You can use these files as a reference or compare your own files to this project and see if you either miss a code or made a typo.

__Can I use this project for the next lessons?__

Sure! Though I would recommend if you use your work instead of these files. That way you can easily navigate through your own files because you know exactly what's what. Another reason is because this project doesn't have modules and an environment file so you'll need to install them before you can use this project.

Feel free to follow the course lessons 1 to 7 in case you wish to use this project:
